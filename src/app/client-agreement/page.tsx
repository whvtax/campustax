      "Refund means any refund, payment, or credit issued by the ATO and paid to the Client's nominated account.",

  {
    title: '2. Acceptance of Terms',
    body: 'By accessing or using our Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Provider and replace any prior communications or representations. By using our Service, you appoint the Provider as your authorised agent to prepare and lodge your tax return with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on your behalf.',
  },
  {
    title: '3. Nature of Service',
    body: 'Our service is provided in two stages: an Eligibility Assessment, in which we review your circumstances and identify what you are entitled to claim, and, if you choose to proceed, the preparation and lodgment of your tax return based on the information you provide. Each stage is separately priced under clause 6, and you will be told the applicable fee before any chargeable work begins. All final tax assessments, refunds, or decisions are made solely by the ATO. We do not guarantee:',

    items: [
      'You have provided true and correct information.',
      'You will notify us of any changes.',

Clients are granted a limited, non-transferable right to use documents solely for personal tax purposes.',

  {
    title: '6. Fees and Charges',
    body: 'Our service is delivered in two stages, each with its own fee. Both fees are disclosed to you and accepted by you before any chargeable work begins.',
    items: [
      'Eligibility Assessment (AUD $110, GST inclusive): a review of your income, residency position and entitlements, identifying the deductions, offsets and exemptions available to you and estimating your likely refund. This fee is charged for the professional time spent on that review. It is not a charge for lodgment, which is a separate service.',
      'No entitlement, no fee: if the Eligibility Assessment concludes that you are not entitled to a refund, the $110 fee is waived in full and nothing is payable by you.',
      'Full service (AUD $220, GST inclusive): if the Eligibility Assessment identifies an entitlement and you instruct us to prepare and lodge your return, the total fee for the engagement is $220. The $110 Eligibility Assessment fee is credited in full towards that amount, so the total payable never exceeds $220.',
      'If you choose to lodge independently or through another provider: where the Eligibility Assessment has been completed and identifies an entitlement, the $110 Eligibility Assessment fee remains payable for the work already performed. No further amount is payable and you remain free to lodge your return however you choose.',
      'Return prepared and awaiting your approval: if you have instructed us to proceed to preparation and we have completed your Tax Return and made it available to you for review, approval or signature, the full engagement fee of $220 is payable, whether or not you subsequently authorise us to lodge it. At that point the work has been performed and delivered; only lodgment, which is an administrative step, remains outstanding. This does not apply where you withdraw because we have failed to provide the Service with due care and skill, or otherwise failed to meet the consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law.',
      'Where the full engagement fee becomes payable under the paragraph above, no additional charge applies and the prepared Tax Return remains available to you.',
      'Work outside the scope of a standard individual return (for example prior-year returns, business or ABN schedules, or amendments to a previously lodged return) will be separately quoted and agreed in writing before that work begins.',
      'Invoices are payable within 7 days of issue.',
      'Nothing in this clause limits, excludes or modifies any right or remedy you may have under the Australian Consumer Law.',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: '7. Payment Terms',
    body: 'Payment is required upon lodgment of your Tax Return, or, where clause 6 provides that a fee becomes payable before lodgment, upon the completion of the relevant stage of work. Payment does not affect or guarantee your refund or ATO outcome.',
  },
  {
    title: '8. Limitation of Liability',
    body: 'Certain guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law cannot be excluded, restricted or modified, and nothing in this Agreement attempts to do so. Subject to those guarantees, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Provider is not responsible for:',

    title: '14. Binding Communications',
    body: 'All communications made via email, WhatsApp, SMS, or other digital platforms are considered valid, binding, and equivalent to written communication. The Provider may take reasonable steps to verify identity to prevent fraud or misuse of the Service.',
  },
  {
    title: '15. Termination',
    body: 'Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time. Termination does not affect any fee that has already become payable under clause 6 for work completed before termination. The Provider may immediately suspend or terminate the Service if:',
    items: [
      'There is a breach of these Terms.',
      'Fraudulent, misleading, or unlawful behaviour is suspected.',

      'The ATO may reduce or withhold your Refund to offset an existing debt, including a tax debt, a Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) debt, a Child Support liability, or a debt owed to another government agency.',
      'An offset of this kind does not change the fees payable under clause 6, because those fees are charged for the professional work performed, not for the size of the Refund you ultimately receive.',
      'The Refund is paid directly into the bank account you nominate. The Provider does not receive, hold or deduct fees from your Refund.',
      'You are responsible for the accuracy of the bank account details you provide. The Provider is not liable for a Refund paid to an incorrect account where those details were supplied by you.',
